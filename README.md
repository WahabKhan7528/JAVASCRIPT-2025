# JAVASCRIPT-SHERIANS

A beginner-friendly JavaScript learning resource organized by core topics. Each folder contains code samples, explanations, and visual aids to help you understand fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## Topics & Subtopics

- **Arrays**
  - Creation, access, modification
  - Methods: push, pop, unshift, shift, splice, slice, reverse, sort
  - Practice sets for slice, splice, sort
  - Advanced sorting (by string length, numbers)
  - Copying arrays (slice before sort)
  - Array methods: map, filter, reduce (with practice sets)
  - Bonus challenges (nested arrays, sum of pairs, filter even indexed items, etc.)

- **Objects**
  - Object creation, key-value pairs
  - Accessing properties (dot/bracket notation)
  - Nesting and deep access
  - Object destructuring
  - Looping: for-in, Object.keys, Object.entries
  - Copying objects: spread, Object.assign, deep cloning (JSON methods)
  - Practice sets (student object, dynamic keys, optional chaining, destructuring, deep cloning, etc.)

- **Control Flow**
  - Conditional statements: if, else if, else
  - Example: grading system function

- **Data Types and Data Systems**
  - *(Currently empty, recommended to add: primitive types, reference types, type conversion, etc.)*

- **Functions**
  - Declaration, expression, arrow functions
  - Parameters vs arguments
  - Default, rest, spread parameters
  - Array and object destructuring
  - Closures, lexical scoping
  - IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
  - Hoisting (declaration vs expression)
  - First-class functions (assign to variables, pass as arguments, return from other functions)
  - Higher-order functions (discount calculator, counter, message box, makeAdder, etc.)
  - Practice sets (BMI calculator, reusable discount calculator, pure functions, etc.)

- **Loops**
  - for, while, do-while loops
  - forEach method, reduce , filter
  - break, continue
  - Practice questions: printing numbers, even/odd, multiplication table, sum, divisibility, user input simulation, stop at first multiple, skip multiples, etc.

- **Operators**
  - Ternary operator
  - *(Recommended to expand: arithmetic, logical, assignment, comparison operators)*

- **Variables and Scope**
  - let, var, const
  - Scope (block, function, global)
  - Hoisting, temporal dead zone
  - Example: ReferenceError with let

- **Timers and Intervals**
  - setTimeout, setInterval
  - clearTimeout, clearInterval
  - Practical examples (countdown, alerts)
  - Feature comparison table
  - Use cases (delay, repeating actions)

- **Session, Local Storage, and Cookies**
  - localStorage: setItem, getItem, removeItem, update
  - sessionStorage: setItem, getItem, removeItem, update
  - Cookies: storing small data, limitations, use cases, automatic server sending

- **Forms and Form Validation**
  - Form submission handling
  - Input validation (length, regex)
  - Custom validation examples

- **Events and Event Handling**
  - Event binding: addEventListener, removeEventListener
  - Event types: click, mouseover, keydown, mouse events, keyboard events, form/input events, clipboard, drag & drop, window, media, network/resource, touch, animation, transition, wheel, pointer
  - Event object (e.target, e.key, e.type)
  - Event bubbling and capturing (with examples and theory)
  - Practice examples (input, select, event removal, etc.)

- **DOM Manipulation**
  - Selecting elements (ID, class, tag, querySelector, querySelectorAll)
  - Changing text (innerText, textContent)
  - Changing HTML (innerHTML)
  - Attribute manipulation (getAttribute, setAttribute, removeAttribute)
  - Dynamic DOM manipulation (create, append, prepend, remove elements)
  - Style updates (.style, classList add/remove/toggle)
  - Practice sets (selecting elements, updating text, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Open each folder and review the `index.html` and `script.js` files for explanations and code samples.
2. Experiment with the code by uncommenting examples and running them in your browser or Node.js.
3. Use the `content.png` images for visual reference where available.
